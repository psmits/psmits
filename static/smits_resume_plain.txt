Experience
----------

Postdoctoral Scholar, University of California Berkeley, Sept 2017 -- present. Project lead for study on predicting when rare events (e.g. extinctions) are likely to be clustered. Developed a discrete-time survival model using Stan to predict probability of species extinction. Generalized results from this survival model to estimate the accuracy of predicting future species extinctions. Wrote online textbook/short-course on analyzing macroecological and paleontological data. Taught graduate level course on applied statistics, Bayesian modeling, and network analysis using R and Stan.

Doctoral Researcher, University of Chicago, Sept 2012 -- June 2017. Completed dissertation on modeling emergent macroecological and macroevolutionary patterns. Analyzed how factors influencing extinction are correlated over time using a multi-level survival model. Developed a multilevel birth-death model to understand how species community structure changes over time. Mentored and taught graduate and undergraduate students in statistics, Stan, R, and pedagogy.

Postgraduate Researcher, Monash University, Sept 2010 -- Aug 2012. Developed thesis on the relationship between tooth shape and jaw movement in carnivorous mammals. Used three-dimensional scans of mammal skulls to reconstruct jaw movement. Used R to analyze relationship among biomechanical measurements. Demonstrated for undergraduate course on introduction to data analysis and R.
