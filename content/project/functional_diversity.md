A species pool is the collection of all species across multiple communities. The members of the pool are thus the collection of *potential* members of any constituent community. A regional species pool defines this collection of communities geographically; for example a community of mammals in North America is part of the North American mammal species pool. 

Understanding if and when a functional group is enriched or depleted in a species pool is a useful conservation tool. An important point worth considering is what enriched or depleted is defined relative to: other contemporaneous communities/species pools, or average relative diversity through time. As a paleontologist I'm able to focus on the latter in the context of large scale historical processes such as speciation, [extinction]({{< ref "/project/extinction_risk.md" >}}), and migration.

My research is concerned with understanding how the functional composition of a species pool changes over time. Additionally, I am interested in how changes to environmental context, such as global temperature or dominant plant groups, can affect the historical processes underlying the presence (or absence) of individual functional groups at any time. My research thus far has focused on changes to mammal functional diversity of the North American species pool over the last 65 million years.
