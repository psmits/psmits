I am writing a webbook on the analysis of paleontological data. The first six chapters are [avaliable here!](https://psmits.github.io/paleo_book/index.html) 

This project started in 2018 when I helped teach a graduate-level class at UC-Berkeley on analytical paleobiology. Since then I have continued to produce short modules covering many different aspects of analytical paleobiology. 

So far I have written lessons on 

1. Importing and cleaning data from the [Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/) using `dplyr` and an emphasis on reproducible analyses.
2. Introduction to the logic of Bayesian data analysis.
3. Introduction to linear regression with a single binary predictor, emphasizing the interpretation of parameters and checking model adequacy.
4. Continuing linear regression by introducing continuous predictors, methods for improving parameter interpretation, and further emphasis on checking model adequacy.
5. Linear regression with categorical predictors with more than two levels, interpreting models with multiple predictors (incl. continuous and discrete), and methods for visualizing multivariate regression.
6. Logistic regression

The next few lessons are expected to cover the following

- Poisson regression
- Random intercepts
- Random slopes
- Phylogenetic mixed models (i.e. phylogenetic effect as random intercept)
- Discrete time series

If you have any suggestions for other materials to cover, please head over to the [book's github page](https://github.com/psmits/paleo_book) and lodge an [issue](https://github.com/psmits/paleo_book/issues).
