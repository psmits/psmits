The ultimate fate of all species is extinction. The rates at which species go extinction varies widely between and within clades. How and why extinction risk varies is vital for understanding the differential diversification of species over time and the processes leading up to the observed diversity composition; why we see the diversity species we do as opposed to some other possible makeup. Extinction is also a distinctly group-level, or emergent, phenomenon as all members of the species need to have died for the species to go extinct.

I'm interested in how taxon functional traits are associated with differences in taxon extinction risk. Functional traits are those which have important (i.e. known) ecological function; examples include mammal tooth shape, environmental preference, and body size. I enjoy focusing on functional traits because I'm able to more clearly, or at least more sensibly, define hypotheses as to why these traits might relate to differences in taxon duration; this is as much for my own clarity as anyone else's. 

As part of my postdoc with [Seth Finnegan](https://finneganlab.org/), I am extending this research to ask and answer questions about how well we are able to predict if a species will go extinct or not at 1 million year time scales. We are analyzing the fantastic fossil record of micro- and nannoplankton from the Cenozoic. Part of this investigation also involves quantifying how much including historical information, such as change in a species geographic range, improves our estimates of extinction probability.
