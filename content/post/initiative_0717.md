I really prefer "group" or "side" initiative as implemented in AD&D 2e and (optionally) in D&D 5e. In group initiative systems, each "side" of the combat (i.e. PCs, NPCs) rolls for initiative together; each side then takes turns acting in initiative order. During each turn, the PCs or NPCs can act in any order. At the end of the round, initiative is re-rolled (my favorite part) and the whole things starts all over again. I've used this system for the last 5 years to great effect; it forces the combat to become a conversation instead of slowing going around the room taking turns.

I'm currently running a few session crawl through the ["Forge of Fury"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forge_of_Fury) and I've decided to use miniatures and a grid for combat to enhance the feel. I wanted to match the increase of granularity with movement and areas of effect with a slightly more grainy initiative system. Taking a small cue from the Fantasy Flight Games Star Wars system, I am now using a hybrid individual-group initiative system and it systems to be working out great. Here it is:

1. PCs roll individual initiative (d20 + initiative mod), while NPCs roll a single initiative die (d20 + avg Dex mod).
2. All PCs that roll above the NPCs' initiative act before the NPCs. All PCs that roll below the NPCs' initiative act after the NPCs.
3. (Optional) PCs/NPCs must complete all actions before the next PC/NPC may act.
4. Re-roll initiative every round.

The optional third point is a switch for increasing or decreasing the granularity of action and the possibility coordinated actions.
