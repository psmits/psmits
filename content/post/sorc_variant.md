To me the [D&D 5E](http://dnd.wizards.com/) sorcerer is the least interesting implementation of the classes. The spellcasting doesn't read as interesting or unique enough to merit choosing to be a sorcerer over, say, a wizard. The sorcery points seem like a wasted opportunity for real spell flexibility. The subclasses that aren't the wild mage don't really grab me, and that is mostly due to nostalgia as my first run through [Baldur's Gate 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldur%27s_Gate_II:_Shadows_of_Amn) was as a wild mage.

Two of my favorite points-based spellcasting implementations were the in the [Wheel of Time RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_Roleplaying_Game) and in [Iron Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Heroes). The similarity between these two systems is that they had access to very few spells, but those spells had many forms and functions depending on how many spell points were invested. The spell point system in the 5E sorcerer tries to do that but I think is sadly humstrung by the Vancian spellcasting which clearly fits the wizard class flavor much better. The following suggestions reflect this preference.

The already built-in choose the spell level features of 5E is a great foundation to work from. Replace the Sorcerer's spell slots with the Variant: Spell Points rule from DMG:288. Combine the spell points with the Sorcerer's normal Sorcery Points; treat them as the same pool for everything.

___

These suggested changes allow the sorcerer to cast and modify their spells very freely which I think improves the unique aspects of their flavor. These ideas are taken from something I read on a traditional games forum, and I claim no ownership to these ideas. Sadly the original post no longer exists, but to whomever suggested these changes, I thank you. I think I'll be using this bit of homebrew for my (hopefully) upcoming Planescape campaign!
