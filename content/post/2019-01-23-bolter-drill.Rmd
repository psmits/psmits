In my spare time I play Warhammer 40k, a game that involves rolling a lot of six-sided dice. My largest army are the Dark Angels, a major chapter of space marines.

Because I've wanted to grow my R skills, I finally wrote my first R package [`mathhammr`](https://github.com/psmits/mathhammr). This lightweight package is a collection functions for simulating collections of dice rolls.

The recently released Bolter Discipline beta rule for 40k is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate the package.

The Bolter Discipline rule DOUBLES the amount of shots from **bolt** weapons! This is huge for the Dark Angels, synergizing very well with their chapter tactic and giving a huge boost to the Deathwing and Ravenwing.


```{r install_package, message=FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) {
    install.packages('devtools')
}
devtools::install_github('psmits/mathhammr')
```

```{r load_package, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
library(forcats)
library(ggplot2)
library(mathhammr)
```


The first thing I want to demonstrate is the effect of Bolter Discipline on my Tactical Marines.

Let's begin by looking at how well a 5-man squad of marines does against another squad of marines before and after Bolter Discipline, at 24 inches and at 12 inches, and having not moved that turn. Let's do this by generating 1000 simulated series.

```{r bolters}
n <- 1000
codex_24 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 5, skill = 3)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))

codex_12 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 10, skill = 3)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))


beta_24 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 10, skill = 3)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))

beta_12 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 20, skill = 3)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))


results <- tibble(
  codex_24,
  codex_12,
  beta_24,
  beta_12
  )

results %>%
  gather(key = 'key', value = 'value') %>%
  tidyr::separate(key, c('type', 'range'), '_') %>%
  mutate(type = case_when(type == 'codex' ~ 'Old rules',
                          type == 'beta' ~ 'Beta rules'),
         type = fct_rev(type),
         range = case_when(range == '12' ~ '<= 12 Inches',
                           range == '24' ~ '<= 24 Inches')) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = value, fill = type)) +
  facet_grid(type ~ range) +
  labs(x = 'Wounds Inflicted by 5 MEQs at MEQ target', y = 'Count') +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  NULL

```


Under the Old Rules there was almost no chance for a squad of Tactical Marines to one-shot 5 MEQs. With the new Beta rules, at less than 12 inches there is a much improved chance of handing out 5 wounds against MEQs.


What's even better is that if DA Infantry can re-roll to-hit rolls of 1 if they stand still. Let's take a look at that.

```{r reroll}
n <- 1000
codex_24 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 5, skill = 3, reroll = 1)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))

codex_12 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 10, skill = 3, reroll = 1)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))


beta_24 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 10, skill = 3, reroll = 1)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))

beta_12 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 20, skill = 3, reroll = 1)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))

results <- tibble(
  codex_24,
  codex_12,
  beta_24,
  beta_12)

results %>%
  gather(key = 'key', value = 'value') %>%
  tidyr::separate(key, c('type', 'range'), '_') %>%
  mutate(type = case_when(type == 'codex' ~ 'Old rules',
                          type == 'beta' ~ 'Beta rules'),
         type = fct_rev(type),
         range = case_when(range == '12' ~ '<= 12 Inches',
                           range == '24' ~ '<= 24 Inches')) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = value, fill = type)) +
  facet_grid(type ~ range) +
  labs(x = 'Wounds Inflicted by 5 MEQs at MEQ target, w/ rerolls', y = 'Count') +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  NULL

```


The effect of the Beta rules is even more pronounced when combined with re-rolls.

And, just for fun, how about Deathwing Terminators firing at MEQs.

```{r terminator}

n <- 1000
codex_24 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 4 * 5, skill = 2)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))

codex_12 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 2 * (4 * 5), skill = 2)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))


beta_24 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 8 * 5, skill = 2)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))

beta_12 <- replicate(n, to_attack(n= 2 * (8 * 5), skill = 2)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_wound(n = .x, str = 4, tgh = 4)) %>%
  map_dbl(., ~ to_save(n = .x, sv = 3, ap = 0))

results <- tibble(
  codex_24,
  codex_12,
  beta_24,
  beta_12)

results %>%
  gather(key = 'key', value = 'value') %>%
  tidyr::separate(key, c('type', 'range'), '_') %>%
  mutate(type = case_when(type == 'codex' ~ 'Old rules',
                          type == 'beta' ~ 'Beta rules'),
         type = fct_rev(type),
         range = case_when(range == '12' ~ '<= 12 Inches',
                           range == '24' ~ '<= 24 Inches')) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = value, fill = type)) +
  facet_grid(type ~ range) +
  labs(x = 'Wounds Inflicted by 5 TEQs at MEQ target', y = 'Count') +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  NULL

```

Terminators totally destroy MEQs with the new Beta rules, it is crazy!
