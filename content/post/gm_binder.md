Robin D Laws has written extensively about the similar role of a Game Master and a show runner (combination writer/producer/director), as well as the utility of thinking about your GMing notes/binder as the "show bible." This metaphor becomes really important when the campaign is truly long-form, spanning over multiple months. 

I've been using campaign binders since 2009 and I keep them as records of my previous campaigns, both successful and not. Each of them stores character sheets, session notes, random tables, and other ephemera I thought might be important to game play. The little collection serves as a great reminder of fantastic adventure and they are still full of useful inspiration and unused ideas.

I use my GM binder both at the table and for prep, which means that I tend to fill them with at-the-ready tools such as random tables, one-shot adventures, and quick world-building details. Importantly, I continue to add material, both notes and tools, to the binder as the campaign progresses; while a GM might have a good idea of the structure and future of a campaign at the beginning, it is flexibility that allows a game to continue without growing pains.

February marks the start of me GMing two very different 5E campaigns: a standard "adventures on the fringe" campaign set in the Forgotten Realms, and a homebrew campaign set in the world developed during an earlier Ryuutama campaign. The former is in person, while the latter in online. While these campaigns differ greatly in tone and content, I've been preparing a binder for both. 

Making a GM binder is obviously connected to GM prep, it breaks it down into two phases: development and deployment. The former (development) involves the gathering of major setting materials, determining scope and tone, and the general process of turning nebulous, unwritten ideas into a concrete concept that can be used to run games with/around; this is pre-campaign prep. The latter (deployment) is when these notes are used at the table; this is game-day prep and session notes.
