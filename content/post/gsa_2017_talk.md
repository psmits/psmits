This GSA, I will be [continuing]({{< relref "/post/pre_evol_2017.md" >}}) to speak on my research about the functional diversity of the North American species pool over the Cenozoic. I'm asking questions about changes to the relative diversity of mammal functional groups in response to climate covariates. In addition, my model takes into account the effects of species mass and taxonomic order on origination and survival. Finally, observation of a fossil species is a function of functional group and species mass. The goal of including all these covariates is to get as complete a picture of the factors structing mammal functional diversity though time.

Since my last talk there have been a number of changes to the model at the center of this study. I've increased the complexity of the model of observation, added the effect of taxonomic order or origination and survival, and I've added a random-walk prior on observation, origination, and survival. This prior choice allows me to better constrain how functional diversity has changed overtime while smoothing random temporal variation. This prior choice has also served to control for correlations between the functional groups.

After my talk is given I will be posting my slides on speakerdeck and have them linked here and in my talks section. Hopefully see you there!
