Like last year, I'm going to be running games through [Games on Demand](http://www.indiegamesondemand.org/)! I've submitted one 2-hour game and two 4-hour games. For the 2-hour slots I'll be running [Feng Shui 2](http://www.atlas-games.com/fengshui/), and for the 4-hour slots I'm providing the option of FS2 or [Into the Odd](http://soogagames.blogspot.com/).

![FS2](/img/fs_2.jpg)

The 2-hour FS2 game is set in Modern Hong Kong where the players are members of the Dragons helping secure an important artifact that the Lotus are trying to steal.

The 4-hour FS2 game is set in Past Canton where the players are members of the Dragons sent to find an old Dragon hero who is attuned to a very powerful feng shui site. Too bad the Ascended and the Guiding Hand have other ideas.

The 4-hour Into the Odd game is actually [The Cursed Chateau](http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=233) by James Maliszewki. The hook is that the artist and anarchist [Joop van Ooms](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/105951/The-Magnificent-Joop-van-Ooms) has hired to the players to recover one of his earliest plays that should never see the light of day let alone be performed. When he was younger, Ooms lent the only copy to Lord Joudain who never returned it. Ooms has warned the players that Lord Joudain is/was a depraved noble man who trafficed in strange and profane Arcanum.

I'll hopefully be running games Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Hope to see you there!
