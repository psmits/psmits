The GM's screen is a major part of my GMing toolkit. The uses are obvious: the GM facing side can have useful information, the player facing side can have art which helps set the mood, and the whole apparatus blocks the GM's notes from easy viewing. My buying the GM screen for a system tends to be a sign that I'm serious about running some games with that system/in that setting.

As I'm sure is pretty common, I've always been pretty protective of RPG items I buy, which means I try to keep them in decent shape and not written in or similar. I've also found that GM screens don't necessarily include the information I want to be in front of me, and instead has a lot of information I *don't* need. That's a lot of the appeal of customizable GM screens like those produced by [Pinnacle/Savage Worlds](https://www.peginc.com/store/savage-worlds-customizable-gm-screen/) and [Hammerdog/the TWGS](http://hammerdog.com/twgs/). Up until recently, I'd never modified an official GM screen to make it more useful.

I've been playing D&D 5E since the Starter Set came out and began by using a [custom GM screen I found online](/pdf/mini_screen5e_cut_marks.pdf). This screen is designed for the mini six-panel 4X6 TWGS customizable screen, which I happened to have bought at GenCon 2014. The information on the custom screen is cleanly presented and covers all the major topics, including a well organized skills panel (more on that later). For the outside I just printed out and inserted some old Russ Nicholson art because of nostalgia. I used this screen until the official 5E screen came out.

When I switched to the official screen I found it a bit lacking. Most of the content was the same but there were a few issues that made me sad. For example, the organization of the Skills section and the lack of Action and Movement types were frustrating. Organizing skills by relevant ability makes much more sense to me than alphabetically, and I found this actually getting in my way of quickly making decisions. So, I decided to give modifying to better suit my needs the screen a shot. 

Almost fortuitously, the 5E GM screen has lots of art space which provides ample space to customize with. While this means that the GM facing art gets covered up, I've found I've been able to pack in a ton of information by splicing the two screens together along with a few print outs. I barely have to remember rules minutiae or grab a manual these days!

Here are some pictures of the ways I've customized three of the four GM facing panels. I'm considering revising the Name Generator section, but I'm unsure what I would replace it with.

I'm curious about other improvements that could be made to various official GM screens to make them more useful, or even convert them across systems! Any examples of ways you've customized your GM screens?
