[Macrostrat](https://macrostrat.org/) is a data service I've written [about before]({{< relref "/post/macrostrat.html" >}}). Today I'm going to explaining how to get the fancy geological unit polygons you see when go to their [interactive](https://macrostrat.org/map/#/z=1.5/x=16/y=23/bedrock/lines/) [geological maps](https://macrostrat.org/burwell/#3/40.80/-94.10). This is not covered or documented in the [Macrostrat API](https://macrostrat.org/api/v2/) -- I only figured it out through snooping, determination, and careful skimming of the [sift](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/sift) source code.

The goal of this "how-to" is to get the map for at least one geological unit. But how do we find this?

The Macrostrat API is not very...expansive. This makes interacting with the API frequently difficult. 

The information we're looking for are associated with the geologic map units. From the API landing page, we'd expect our map information to be somewhere along the `/geologic_units` path. From the landing page there appear to be only three paths forward `/geologic_units/gmna`, `/geologic_units/gmus/`, and `/geologic_units/map`. That last one seems right, right?

Navigating to the [`/geologic_units/map` page](https://macrostrat.org/api/v2/geologic_units/map) gives us some breadcrumbs for our journey.

To get a map back from the Macrostrat API we need to provide some information about what geological units we want. There are seven parameter options: scale, map_id, lat, lng, strat_name_id, unit_id, and format. If we use latitude and longitude coordinates when calling for maps, the response includes all geological map units that interset with that point. If we use a `map_id` or `unit_id`, we'll get back one or more maps -- you can ask for multiple maps using a comma seperated string. Something that is extremely important is the format option -- depending on what option you use, you may or may not get the map coordinates. To guarentee map information, I use the `geojson` format.

Additionally, to make this all easier, we're going to use the `geojsonsf` package to read in our data. It just makes everything easier.
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(jsonlite)
library(sf)
library(geojsonsf)

call <-'https://macrostrat.org/api/v2/units?interval_name=Miocene&response=long&format=csv'
unit_data <- read_csv(call) %>%
  group_by(col_id) %>%
  mutate(t_age_max = max(t_age),
         b_age_max = max(b_age)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(t_age_max > 22 & b_age_max < 33,
         clng < 0,
         abs(abs(clat) - 37) < 10,
         abs(abs(clng) - 122) < 10)    # nearish to SF

unit_id <- unit_data %>%
  pull(unit_id) %>%
  unique(.) %>%
  sort(.) %>%
  paste0(., collapse = ',')

# write an API call
call <- paste0('https://macrostrat.org/api/v2/geologic_units/map?unit_id=', unit_id, '&format=geojson_bare')
data <- geojson_sf(call)               # convert the Macrostrat data into an sf object
glimpse(data)
```

The above code chunk first makes an API call to the Macrostract database. This response data has each geological unit as a row and tons of information on each unit. Importantly, there are multiple geological units per Macrostrat column id -- it is the columns which have map properties, not the units themselves.

Here is an explination of what is displayed when you `print(...)` an sf object.

sf objects are very powerful and there are many analyses we can do with them. The simplest question we can ask is "what the area of each geological map?"
```{r}
data %>%
  mutate(area = as.numeric(st_area(.)),
         area_log = log(area),
         m_age = (t_age + b_age) / 2) %>%
  ggplot(.) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = area_log)) +
  NULL
```

Because our data is an `sf` object, it is easy to slice and dice our data and try to get a better handle on it. We can also plot our sf object. I'll use `ggplot2` because I like it. A neat bit of information is the color vector -- this is a vector of suggested hex codes to color your polygons based on their lithologies. You can also see the `map_id`-s -- our call returned four maps. The other fields are described in the [Macrostrat API](https://macrostrat.org/api/v2/geologic_units/map). I'll take advantage of that when plotting the units
```{r}
# let's only plot one of the units
# decrease the number of units
temp <- data %>%
  filter(as.numeric(st_area(.)) < 2000)

pal <- data$color
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = data, mapping = aes(fill = as.factor(map_id))) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = pal, name = 'Geological Map ID') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  NULL
```

Because our map data is an sf object, it is very easy to take advantage of the whole suite of spatial analysis tools avaliable. For more information see the [sf documentation](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html).
