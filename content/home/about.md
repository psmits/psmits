# Biography

My training is as a paleobiologist. My previous academic work focused on analyzing macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns in the fossil record. My research focused on trait-dependent extinction, dynamics of functional diversity of species pools, and Bayesian approaches to modeling evolutionary and ecological data. My research has spaned a wide variety of taxa from mammals to crocodilians to forams, though my PhD focused on Cenozoic mammals and Paleozoic brachiopods. A common across my work is a continued use of modern statistics and data science tools such as [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).

I did my PhD with the with the Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago where I was advised by [Michael Foote](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/michael-foote/) and [Kenneth Angielczyk](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/611). I then completed a post-doc in [Seth Finnegan's lab](https://finneganlab.org/) at University of California -- Berkeley. I have since left academic science.

I'm a huge fan of tabletop role-playing games e.g. [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/). I can regularly be found GMing in the wild at [BigBadCon](http://www.bigbadcon.com/) with groups like [Games on Demand](http://www.indiegamesondemand.org/).
