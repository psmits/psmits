# Biography

I study macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns observable in the fossil record. My research interests include trait-dependent extinction, understanding changes to functional diversity of species pools, and Bayesian approaches to modeling evolutionary and ecological data. Taxonomically, my research focuses on Cenozoic mammals and Paleozoic brachiopods. I use a lot of modern statistics and data science tools such as [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).

I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in [Seth Finnegan's lab](https://finneganlab.org/) at University of California -- Berkeley. Previously, I was a graduate student at the University of Chicago where I was advised by [Michael Foote](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/michael-foote/) and [Kenneth Angielczyk](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/611). 


I'm also a huge fan of tabletop role-playing games like [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/). I can regularly be found GMing in the wild at [BigBadCon](http://www.bigbadcon.com/) with groups like [Games on Demand](http://www.indiegamesondemand.org/).
