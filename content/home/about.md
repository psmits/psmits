# Biography

I am a Data Science Fellow at Insight Data Science in Seattle.

My training is in paleobiology and macroevolutionary biology. My previous work focused on analyzing macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns in the fossil record. Particular phenomena of interest included trait-dependent extinction, dynamics of functional diversity of species pools, and Bayesian approaches to modeling evolutionary and ecological data. My research has spanned a wide variety of taxa from mammals to crocodilians to forams, though my PhD focused on Cenozoic mammals and Paleozoic brachiopods. A common across my work is a continued use of modern statistics and data science tools such as [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/).

I did my PhD as part of the Committee on Evolutionary Biology at the University of Chicago where I was advised by [Michael Foote](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/michael-foote/) and [Kenneth Angielczyk](https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/staff/profile/611). I then completed a post-doc in [Seth Finnegan's lab](https://finneganlab.org/) at University of California -- Berkeley. I have since left academic science.

I'm a huge fan of tabletop role-playing games e.g. [Dungeons and Dragons](http://dnd.wizards.com/). I can regularly be found GMing in the wild at [BigBadCon](http://www.bigbadcon.com/) with groups like [Games on Demand](http://www.indiegamesondemand.org/).
